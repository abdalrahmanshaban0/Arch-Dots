## Connect to internet (WIFI)
```shell
rfkill unblock wifi

iwctl
device list
# replace wlan0 with your device
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 connect SSID
```
## archinstall
proceed with minimal profile with NetworkManager, pipewire and grub selected.
## Post fresh installation
### connect to internet:
```shell
nmtui # Activiate connection
```
### Install yay (AUR helper):
```shell
mkdir .src
cd .src
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay-git
makepkg -si
```
### Install Hyprland dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland-wiki
```
open using vim pages/Getting Started/Installation
copy the dependencies of Arch Linux manual installation (y in vim)
``:term`` in vim and paste it and enjoy you don't have to write them one by one :'D
## Build and install Hyprland
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland
cd Hyprland
make all && sudo make install
```
## Multi-GPU or NVIDIA

## Display manager and Hyprland session
The recommended way to start Hyprland is using uwsm in systemd distros (or just write Hyprland after login in tty).
why not SDDM ? 
- It possibly crashes when you make its display server and greeter environment wayland.
- It slows the process to get into your system.
- I have bad history with it.
```shell
sudo pacman -S uwsm vim
```
To launch Hyprland directly after tty login :
paste this in your shell profile (mostly ~/.bashrc)
```shell
if uwsm check may-start; then
    exec uwsm start hyprland.desktop
fi
```
## Install or make your dots
I already have configs for my workflow on Hyprland on a GitHub repo. You can also clone them and edit to fit yours.

## Install all your favorite programs from a scirpt
You may install  some programs or dependencies on demand or don't remember to write then in a single script for installation, a tip for that is to open ~/.bash_history and search for every -S and collect these packages in a script. But first, you must know and choose what these programs are.

### Video editting
Kdenlive sucks and Davinci Resolve on Linux doesn't support H.264 codec (the paid version does, also you can transcode all of your project videos for some hours and torture your hardware). The best solution for me is using a GPU that supports AV1 video encoder.<br>
I'm currently using an AMD CPU that contains an integrated graphics that has AV1 encoder. You need to download packages to support OpenCl to make Davinci Resolve work:
```sh
sudo pacman -S rocm-opencl-runtime opencl-rusticl-mesa
```
### Dual boot
I'm dual booting on 2 different drives and choose which one to boot in using Grub. To make Grub supports that :
```shell
yay -S os-prober
```
Edit /etc/default/grub to uncomment the line (maybe last line) :
```
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```
You add a Grub theme (install one from gnome-look) also in this line : 
```
GRUB_THEME=/boot/grub/themes/Xenlism-Arch/theme.txt
```
update grub (generating grub.cfg)
```
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
